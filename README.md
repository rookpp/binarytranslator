# binarytranslator
| Hobby project, takes binary input and translates it into ASCII (WIP) |
Use as you please, it's not crazy effort and can be easily remade so don't credit I don't really care.
Will eventually take it off the terminal and try making an actual application for it, is it practical or useful? Not really, but it's fun to work on.
