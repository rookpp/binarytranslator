# binarytranslator
| Hobby project, takes binary input and translates it into ASCII (WIP) |
Use as you please, it's not crazy effort and can be easily remade so don't credit I don't really care.
Will eventually take it off the terminal and try making an actual application for it, is it practical or useful? Not really, but it's fun to work on.

DIRECTIONS TO RUN
Upon installing, you will have to first build it using the makefile, upon which an executable should be created. From there just run the executable from a terminal. 



Abandoned, I will completely redo this eventually but I am realizing how inefficient this code is
